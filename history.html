            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Opposite Day was made popular by President Dwight Eisenhower to please his granddaughter, but he only set it as one day. He declared it to take place on August 17th. Though it is celebrated nationally on January, 25th, some people argue that it is supposed to take place on January 7th.<br /><br />This holiday is an anti-holiday because it can be celebrated on every day except the day it takes place. Opposite day is a paradox. If everything is opposite, then the day of opposites is an opposite, making it not the day of opposites. This doesn't make sense, but that's okay.</p>
